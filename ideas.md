  **Design Movement**: "Swiss Style / International Typographic Style" meets "Modern Clinical"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Objective Clarity**: Information is presented with absolute precision and no ambiguity.
  2. **Grid-Based Asymmetry**: Strong grid systems but with dynamic, asymmetrical layouts to create visual interest and forward momentum (propulsion).
  3. **Trust through Structure**: The reliability of the service is communicated through the reliability of the design structure.
  4. **Human Warmth**: Balancing the clinical precision with warm, authentic photography of real interactions.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **DocPropel Blue (#1E73BE)**: Used for primary structural elements and trust indicators. Represents medical authority.
  - **DocPropel Orange (#F58220)**: Used strictly for "propulsion" elements—CTAs, progress indicators, and growth metrics. It's the energy source.
  - **Clinical White (#FFFFFF) & Light Medical Gray (#F2F4F6)**: Dominant background colors to maintain a sterile, clean feel without being cold.
  - **Deep Charcoal (#1F2A37)**: For high-contrast typography to ensure readability.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Split-Screen Hero**: Asymmetrical split (60/40) with strong typography on one side and a dynamic, cut-out image on the other.
  - **Modular Cards**: Services and features presented in clean, bordered cards with generous padding.
  - **Horizontal Rhythm**: Sections that flow horizontally (e.g., a timeline of growth) to emphasize the "propel" concept.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **The "Pulse" Line**: A subtle, animated SVG line that mimics a heartbeat/EKG but transforms into a growth chart. Used as a section divider or background element.
  - **Molecular Patterns**: Very faint, geometric background patterns (dots or connected nodes) representing the network of patients and providers.
  - **Floating Metrics**: Small, card-like elements floating over images showing "New Patient +1" or "ROI +300%" to reinforce performance.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Hover-to-Reveal**: Cards that slightly lift and reveal more detail or a "Book Now" arrow on hover.
  - **Smooth Scroll**: A very polished, slightly dampened scroll experience.
  - **Data Animation**: Numbers in the comparison table and ROI sections count up when they enter the viewport.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements slide in from the bottom with a slight stagger.
  - **Pulse**: The orange CTA buttons have a very subtle, periodic "pulse" shadow effect.
  - **Propulsion**: When clicking a "Get Started" button, a swift transition animation that feels like moving forward.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Inter** (Bold/SemiBold). Tight tracking for a modern, authoritative look.
  - **Body**: **Inter** (Regular). High legibility, generous line height (1.6).
  - **Numbers/Metrics**: **Space Grotesk** or a monospaced variant of Inter to highlight the data-driven nature of the service.

  **Design Movement**: "Neumorphism 2.0" / "Soft UI"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Tactile Realism**: Elements look like they can be touched and pressed, creating a sense of connection.
  2. **Softness & Comfort**: Avoiding harsh lines to evoke a sense of care and healing.
  3. **Focus through Depth**: Using shadows and light to guide the eye rather than just color.
  4. **Seamless Flow**: Sections blend into each other without hard borders.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **DocPropel Blue**: Used as a soft glow or gradient overlay.
  - **DocPropel Orange**: Used for active states and "lit" elements.
  - **Off-White/Cream**: Backgrounds are not pure white but a very light, warm gray to support the shadow play.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Centralized Focus**: Key elements are centered and "lifted" off the page.
  - **Rounded Everything**: Large border radii on cards, buttons, and images.
  - **Layered Depth**: Background elements are blurred and recessed, while content floats on top.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Soft Shadows**: Inner and outer shadows to create the neumorphic look.
  - **Frosted Glass**: Glassmorphism effects for navigation and overlays.
  - **Organic Shapes**: Blobs and curves in the background instead of rigid grids.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Pressable Buttons**: Buttons that physically look like they depress when clicked.
  - **Gentle Parallax**: Background shapes move slowly as you scroll.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade & Float**: Elements gently fade in and float into position.
  - **Soft Transitions**: No sharp cuts; everything dissolves or morphs.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Nunito** or **Quicksand** (Rounded sans-serifs).
  - **Body**: **Lato**.

  **Design Movement**: "Brutalist Utilitarian"
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Functionality**: The design strips away all decoration to focus purely on the "performance" aspect.
  2. **High Contrast**: Black and white dominance with stark splashes of brand colors.
  3. **Big Data**: Metrics are the heroes, displayed in massive font sizes.
  4. **Unapologetic Boldness**: Reflecting the confidence of a performance-based model.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **DocPropel Blue**: Used for massive typography.
  - **DocPropel Orange**: Used for highlighters and underlines.
  - **Black & White**: The primary palette.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Grid Lines**: Visible grid lines separating content.
  - **Monospace Layout**: Information presented like a technical dashboard or medical chart.
  - **No Whitespace**: Dense, information-rich sections.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Visible Borders**: Every element has a thick black border.
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text banners with key benefits.
  - **Raw Photography**: Unedited, high-flash photography style.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant Response**: No smooth transitions; instant hover states.
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle tech glitches on hover.

  **Animation**:
  - **Typewriter Effect**: Text appearing character by character.
  - **Flash**: Elements flashing on appearance.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Oswald** or **Impact**.
  - **Body**: **Courier Prime** (Monospace).
